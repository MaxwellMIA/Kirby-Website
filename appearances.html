                <h1>Where Has Kirby Been?</h1>
                <h2>Main series</h2>
                <blockquote>Main article: Kirby (series)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Kirby's primary media form is video games, as he is the star and protagonist of the Nintendo owned series named after him. Most Kirby games are platform games in which Kirby fights enemies, solves puzzles, and challenges bosses. Each game typically adds a new twist or change to Kirby's abilities that the levels of the game emphasize, such as combining power ups in Kirby 64 or Super Abilities in Return to Dream Land. Most games involve Kirby saving a world or even universe from a dark, evil force of some kind. Typical Kirby games have a powerful being, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare, controlling or corrupting a secondary villain.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>The series has 26 games currently, with the first being Kirby's Dream Land in 1992 and the latest being Kirby Star Allies in 2018. Although most are platform games, some spin offs have included pinball, racing, and puzzle games.</blockquote>
                <h2>Super Smash Bros. series</h2>
                <blockquote>Kirby appears in the Super Smash Bros. series of games as a playable character, which is also created by Masahiro Sakurai. He is the sole Kirby series representative in Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee, and has been one of three (the others being Meta Knight and King Dedede) as of Super Smash Bros. Brawl. He reprises his role as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the latter of which features him playing a starring role in the "World of Light" story mode.</blockquote>
                <h2>Anime</h2>
                <blockquote>Main article: Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Kirby appears in his own anime titled Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, in Japan. The series was licensed in North America by 4Kids Entertainment and the Canadian company Nelvana, and produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and HAL Laboratory. It aired on 4Kids TV, via Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting (since 2001 which has done 100 episodes).</blockquote>
                <blockquote>The anime series is set in its own universe independent of the games and offers its own take on the setting and characters, however, Kirby's creator, Masahiro Sakurai, was greatly involved in its creation, so it did not stray far from his vision of how Kirby should be. The anime contains darker themes such as war, and death while still maintaining the cheerful and surreal themes the games are known for.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>In the anime Kirby's origin and backstory are explored much more deeply than in the games. Kirby is a legendary Star Warrior who, according to legend, is fated to save Pop Star from destruction, but he was awoken from his slumber 200 years too early by mistake and as such has many baby or childlike qualities. Because of his age, he is still getting the hang of his powers and depends even more on the help of his friends to pull through tough situations. It is also implied that Kirby was originally a creation of the ancient evil entity called Nightmare but refused to follow his evil orders and was discarded into the depths of space.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Kirby's Warpstar is also expanded upon, as in the games it is a mode of transportation, but here the Warpstar is also the source of his power but as he's too young to keep it safe for himself the character Tiff takes it upon herself to keep the Warpstar safe.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Though Sakurai instructed that Kirby not speak in full sentences (citing the Peanuts character Snoopy) he did allow him to use a small vocabulary including a catch phrase "Poyo" and the names of various attacks and characters.</blockquote>

                <h2>Manga and comics</h2>
                <blockquote>Kirby also stars in several manga series, most of which have only been released in Japanese. The longest running series is titled (lit. Kirby of the Stars: The Story of Dedede In Pupupu) running up to 25 books, and was written by Hirokazu Hikawa. While Viz Media originally had plans to release the manga in English on September 2010. This release date was pushed back to October 4, 2011 before being canceled completely on May 16, 2011.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>Other Kirby manga are typically one-shot comedy 4koma gag-manga based on the games, and have multiple artists.</blockquote>
                <blockquote>The German Club Nintendo magazine often featured comics starring various Nintendo characters including Kirby. In his comics Kirby is reimagined as a detective and King Dedede as his sidekick. These comics were promotions for Kirby games that were released in Germany at the time including Kirby's Dream Land 2, Kirby's Avalanche, and Kirby's Dream Course.</blockquote>
